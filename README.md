## Systems Programming and Security, Personal Portfolio

This repository is essentially my playground with system programming and systems software. I work with system programming, memory management, linux internals, security basics, and some low-level programming. 
The code that I write in this repository is mostly experimental and not strictly necessary to produce any kind of results. The projects I include here might be experimental, 
some might be left undone, and some might be progenitors of larger projects.

### Repository Structure
----------------

“The repository is organized to function for learning, building, and experimenting separately:”


#### Learning:

labs/

Learning by phase.

This is where most of the lab work is in terms of the memory allocators and tracing and networking. 
This part of the code is more about understanding a concept than being neat.

Ongoing Project:

I am currently involved in a project named the ‘Development of a Security Monitor’ tool.
The project is an ongoing process that develops as more is learned about the process and system, as well as about ELF and memory.

Projects not following the typical track, including side endeavors.
Certain plans, documents, and references are classified as confidential information, so these are not included in the publicly accessible repository.

----------
#### What To Expect and What Not To
----------

You Will Find:

- C code at a low-level system interface.
- Custom allocators & tracing experiments
- Comments around the code where there was confusion or a misunderstanding. 

What you won’t find:

- Ready-for-sale software 
- “Neat abstractions everywhere” 
- Perfect commits or finished libraries 

It’s a learning repository, not an example showcase.

#### Why This Exists
-----------

I learn by making something out of nothing, taking it apart, and so on. This repository is my learning record. If things look bad, it is probably intended that way. 

------------
#### License
------------

This learning repository has been placed for educational use. It is obviously intended for single-use only.
